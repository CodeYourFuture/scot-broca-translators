      <p>
        @scotlandclass3 These are the three projects you will build this year!
        :tada: Translators/interpreters network: An app to create a user-based
        network of volunteer interpreters/translators. Translators will be able
        to create profiles with the language they speak. The History Project
        (which is part of a real organisation) can upload chosen archival pieces
        to the app and requests their translation from volunteer interpreters.
        They can also upload invites and other texts for translation and
        distribution. As a stretch goal, Users can also use the app as a
        platform to upload texts or photos of texts in another language that
        they do not understand, including what we commonly nickname “legalese”.
