        These are the three projects you will build this year!
        <br />
        :tada: Translators/interpreters network: <br />
        An app to create a user-based network of volunteer
        interpreters/translators. Translators will be able to create profiles
        with the language they speak.
        <br /> The History Project (which is part of a real organisation) can
        upload chosen archival pieces to the app and requests their translation
        from volunteer interpreters.
        <br />
        They can also upload invites and other texts for translation and
        distribution. As a stretch goal,
        <br /> Users can also use the app as a platform to upload texts or
        photos of texts in another language that they do not understand, <br />
        including what we commonly nickname “legalese”.
