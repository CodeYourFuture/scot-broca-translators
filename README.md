# Get started

1. Create a fork of this project
2. Clone your fork into your local machine.
3. Add an `upstream` remote pointing to the main CYF repo (to be able to pull updates from your team members).
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/scot-broca-translators.git.

After cloning the project, we will create the local database that the project will use.

## Database

- Open the terminal, and `cd` into `server`
- Create your database: `createdb final_project`
- `npm run recreate-db:local` (this will create and populate your new team's DB with the data your colleague added)

> Your actual database schema will go to `server/db/recreate-schema.sql` and you can add sample test data in `server/db/populate-db.sql`

## Test it all works

Now let us test that the whole stack works (the `React frontend` connects to the `Node API` which connects to the `Postgres Database` )

- Open a terminal, navigate to the root of the project and do `npm install`
- `cd` into `server` and run `npm run dev`
- On a different terminal, `cd` into `client` and run `npm run dev`

Once the React website opens in a browser. Navigate to the _Status_ page, and you should see two users listed in the page. This means everything works fine.

# Development Process

Read the [Development process](CONTRIBUTING.md).

> IMPORTANT: Make sure you read and understand the development proces guidelines before starting any work. Ask mentors for explanation if you have any questions.

# Project structure

The project is divided into `client` folder for the React frontend, and a `server` folder for the node API and database side.

> This structure is called a mono repo. As opposed to having two repos (one for client, another for server), we opted for a `monorepo`. You can read more about [monorepos](https://gomonorepo.org/).

## The Client

The client is a React app created with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). In addition to the default setup, we have added [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) with 3 routes for testing

- The `components` live in the `components` folder. When the project gets bigger, we might separate them into logical folders (i.e. `components/admin` for admin-related components, and `components/profile` for user profile-related components)

- The `api` folder contains modules to call a specific API, i.e. when you add a new endpoint to list, craete and update _jobs_ then you can add a new module called `api/jobs.js` that can contain methods such as `getJobs, createJob, deleteJob ...`.

- The tests live with the modules. Some projects put the tests in a top-level folder `__tests` but we chose that they live with the components they test, i.e. a test for `About.js` will be in a file called `About.test.js` at the same level in the folder.

- Styles are in the folder `client/styles`. Each file in that folder will contain styles related to a specific component (and have the same name), i.e. a component called `About.js` might define styles in `styles/About.css` and import them.

### Component library

We will use [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) component library for the projects. Check out the documentation to get familiar with it.

## Server

The API is implemented using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. We have added some extra functionality, such as a simple authentication solution.

- `db` folder contains the script to run to create the database, the schema and seed it with sample data. Whenever you want to add a new database table or change an existing, you will likely change it in `db/recreate-schema.sql`.

- `services` folder contain `database` services. These are modules to manipulate a certain entity in the database. For example, if you have a table called `documents`, you might add a module `services/database/documents` that will expose methods like `addDocument, getDocumentById` and implement an `SQL` statement to perform the required functionality.

- `api` When you add a new API, for example for managing `questions`. You can add it at `api/index.js`. This will define the _prefix_ so for example,

```js
const questions = require("./questions");
router.use("/questions", questions);
```

and in `questions` module you will define the routes. Note these will all be prefixed with _questions_.

For example

```js
// questions.js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// This route is GET /questions/ (because everything in this file is "mounted" on the prefix questions from the previous step)
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("All good");
});

module.exports = router;
```

This structure using `Express.Router` allows our code to be _modular_ and minimise conflict between team members. You can read more about [Express Router](expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router)

> Typically a server-side user story will involve:
>
> 1. Define a table in `db/recreate-schema.sql`
> 2. Create an API endpoint `api/some_table.js`
> 3. Create a service under `services/databases/some_table.js` (this will contain the SQL to connect the API and the database)

## Authentication and Authorisation

The project has routes and services to implement an authentication / authorisation solution. It depends on [passportjs](http://www.passportjs.org/) library, and implements an authentication strategy called JWT. To understand more authentication, you can read [this article](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/learn-using-jwt-with-passport-authentication-9761539c4314).

To test authentication:

- In Postman, do a _GET_ on `http://localhost:4000/api/status/protected`. You should receive a `403` (Forbidden) as a response.

- Register a user by doing a _POST_ to `http://localhost:4000/auth/register` with the body looking like:

```json
{
  "email": "myemail@gmail.com",
  "password": "mypassword"
}
```

Don't forget to set the `content-type` to `raw` and `application/json`

- Now you can login by doing a _POST_ to `http://localhost:4000/auth/login` with a body similar to:

```json
{
  "email": "myemail@gmail.com",
  "password": "mypassword"
}
```

This will bring you back a `token`. Copy the token you get in the response.

- Now, we can use this token for the `status/protected` route. Do a _GET_ request to `http://localhost:4000/api/status/protected` and add a `header` with the name `Authorization` and the value: `Bearer the_token_from_previous step`, i.e. `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjMsImlhdCI6MTU2NTkwOTU4OX0.qidn4r7nrolFByyfd956Kh8BkOhwcaUSzyUK0V7su1c`
